# Two version of gui app for reading `sr400` two channel gated photon counter and handling data

tho mind warn you that this apps only for `<=2000` number of periods see [manual](https://www.thinksrs.com/downloads/pdfs/manuals/SR400m.pdf), you can resolve this buffer problem by attaching ardiono or any chip for your liking

# gui app

## via lib

* ///libs and soft to down load///
* /// how to use///

## how to make .exe



## voltage set(example of output data usage)

For colibration system( via dark counts and gui app get this graph)

idk what is happening here(175-220mV), but after this decided to set sr400 at `DISC lvl=+250 mV` (where limit is `-300 -- + 300`)
